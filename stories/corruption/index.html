<a href=https://robinwords.com/stories/corruption/>Corruption</a></li></ul><div id=post><p>Power, one of the many things that can corrupt a person&rsquo;s life.
One who has power has nothing, indeed, but the power to make people think that power is real; that power can control their lives - thus, a corruption is born.
Had people in this cruel world of 3004 realized the bozmarks were controling every aspect of their lives ; well it would be a much different story. Of course, I the hero noticed, I Samueli Warco, saved them all from the monsterous people turned into bozmarks. The monsters formed in an asylum never herd of. Of course I&rsquo;m spoiling everything now it&rsquo;s a party we&rsquo;re at now let me tell you the full story. Grab a drink it&rsquo;s gona be a long and nightmarish night.</p><p>First I supose I should clarify what exactly a bozmark is. They looked just like normal people, but were just pupets, i&rsquo;m still searching for the pupetmaster however.</p><p><strong>written by:</strong></p><p><code>AlenaFek</code></p><p><code>seemli</code></p><p><code>carpinteyroeyw</code></p><p><code>kingluck257</code></p></div></main><p class=footer>&copy; 2008-2020 RobinWords.
