Some of Aaron&rsquo;s games had grownup matters in them, such as taxes and work.
One day, the company behind Aaron&rsquo;s favorite series of tax and work based games was acquired by EA. Aaron, being a loyal fan of the series, bought the new entry in the series after the corporate takeover. &quot;All these review sites say this game is perfect, so I should buy it!&quot; said Aaron to no one in particular as he bought the game on his computer.
He had bad internet, so the always online DRM stopped him from playing. He bought the anti-online-DRM-and-400-new-cats DLC for 300 US dollars.</p><p>He is. Aaron.
