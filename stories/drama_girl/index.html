<a href=https://robinwords.com/stories/drama_girl/>Drama Girl</a></li></ul><div id=post><p>&rdquo; Hey, dork&rdquo; Britany snickered, her brown hair in a strait cheer leader ponytail, her 10000$ dollar outfit flawless. &ldquo;Oh, back off,&rdquo; I snapped, my red hair extremly tight curly, my makeup probaly smudged. &ldquo;Oh, look&rsquo;s like nerd girl is mad. too bad. i do not care,&rdquo; She smirked, and sashayed away with her clone-like friends. &ldquo;I hate Miss drama girl&rdquo; I said harshly and grumbled off.</p><p>And then I realized that this was all pointless! The bad grammar, syntax, plot, and characters that made up my life were just that. Bad! Worthless! No good! I immediately decided to straighten myself back up. I dyed my hair back to its original color, which was brown, stopped damaging it with curling irons, and brought my grades back. I backed off on Minecraft, and LoL, and Black Ops and decided to to volunteer. Even if I was nerd, I would be an amiable person, and nice to everyone. Even Britany, who was actually really pretty and only mean to me because I had made fun of her all through elementary school.
End.</p><p>But there was one more battle to fight, Britany still controled the school. But revenge came, I had control of what she most wanted; John the cutest boy in our school. Every girl likes him but he has asked me out ! Britany is trying to make my life awful but I got defence. This time I truly won for the finalie. Or is it really the end?</p><p>Obviously it&rsquo;s not. Britany had a card she played that ruined my life, her life, and my family&rsquo;s. I had to stop whatever her plan was. I know now of course since I&rsquo;m telling you this. But back then, I thought I won. I didn&rsquo;t gloat or react. This angered her even more. Though peace and quiet reighned for 3 weeks, Britany was getting desparate. She wanted her popularity back. NOW. It was only a mater of time untill she relesed the problem.</p><p><strong>written by:</strong></p><p><code>raki</code></p><p><code>monclercemy</code></p><p><code>franklinmaxvr</code></p><p><code>carpinteyrorqp</code></p><p><code>Dersuay</code></p></div></main><p class=footer>&copy; 2008-2020 RobinWords.
