You weren&rsquo;t there. No one was really. Really it began last spring when I received a letter in the mail.

I noticed the mailman come up to my house and put a few letters. I got up and checked them out. Bills,bills,someone died,bills,and wait a lottery letter ?</p><p>Few people even get to go on vacations in their life these days. Few places in the world are left that anyone would even want to vacation to.</p><p><strong>written by:</strong></p><p><code>JimRobin</code></p><p><code>dtrain21</code></p><p><code>carpinteyrozcn</code></p><p><code>zoointwst</code></p><p><code>Aertanis</code></p></div></main><p class=footer>&copy; 2008-2019 RobinWords.
