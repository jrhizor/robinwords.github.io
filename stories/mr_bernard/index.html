He was actually quite strange&hellip;
every afternoon at exactly 5:00, he would disappear into his janitor closet and not come out for 45 minutes.
People who worked in the building wondered what Mr. Bernard did in his closet so they went to inspect.
When they opened the door to investigate, it was empty with the exception of all the custodial supplies. Upon walking inside, they heard laughter inside the wall across from the closet&rsquo;s entrance.
But once they walked our and investigated the wall, they could find no source for the laughter.
