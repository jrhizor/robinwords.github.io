<a href=https://robinwords.com/stories/chicken/>Chicken</a></li></ul><div id=post><p>A pair of beady eyes gleamed in the darkness, distracting me from sleep.
I sat up quickly and saw the body that the eyes belonged to at the foot of my bed.
But it wasn&rsquo;t a human body
The moaning and chilled air suggested something else&hellip;
something darker</p><p>It felt awful. The fealing that &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; thing was giving me shone darckly of a desire. A desire to destroy the world, a desire to kill anything in its way, a desire &hellip;&hellip; to kill me.</p><p>I yelled. No noise came out of my mouth. Getting out of bed was not an option the body of the monster was one I knew well though. It was that of the neighbors most hated chicken. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. I hoped this was all a dream and covered my head with my blanket. Suddenly I heard as it jumped. It jumped on the bed and I was sweating like a dog. I felt it rear up and &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. I fealt nothing. I opened my eyes seeing it was still dark and totally real.I peaked out. The chicken was frozen in place. Weird.</p><p><strong>written by:</strong></p><p><code>IloveKim310</code></p><p><code>duffy1940</code></p><p><code>justriita</code></p><p><code>GenSewmance</code></p><p><code>Bailey27Camille</code></p><p><code>alliberns</code></p><p><code>Lydiia</code></p></div></main><p class=footer>&copy; 2008-2022 RobinWords.
