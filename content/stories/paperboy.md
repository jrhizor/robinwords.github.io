Being a paperboy is actually harder than I thought it would be.

I start on Morrison Avenue. Three blocks down is the Smithsons' aggressive dog. Take a left turn to avoid the Robinson house party. Don't forget to give out two copies for the maroon house with the brown roof. Finish the crossword puzzle for the children next door. At all costs, stay away from Harridan Street.
I MUST. STAY. AWAY.
