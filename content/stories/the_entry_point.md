If I hadn't stumbled splashing into the stream in the night, if I hadn't thrown my soaked pants over the tree limb and crawled, shivering, into my sleeping bag, if I hadn't pulled the jeans roughly down in the morning when I heard voices coming, if my yank hadn't brought the limb of the tree low and revealed the doorknob above it on the trunk of the tree- if I hadn't gone on the trip at all, the boundaries of my world would not have stretched and shifted this summer.

I suppose I'm getting a bit ahead of myself aren't I?

Of course you wouldn't know what I'm talking about. You weren't there. No one was really. Really it began last spring when I received a letter in the mail.
I was sitting on my porch thinking about how unfair those random lottery vacation wins were when I noticed Bosco my loyal cat minx getting agitated.He only did this when mail came and come it did. I noticed the mailman come up to my house and put a few letters. I got up and checked them out. Bills,bills,someone died,bills,and wait a lottery letter ?

Few people even get to go on vacations in their life these days. Few places in the world are left that anyone would even want to vacation to.
