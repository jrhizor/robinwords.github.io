There he laid. Only knowing of his fate, not of his origins, journey, nor his companions. The knowledge of his fate he dreaded.
He had been told this day would come, but now as he stared at the ceiling he knew the end was near. The end of his naive nature, the end of his denial of who he really was. Now he had to face the man, but it could wait until morning. That he could allow himself.
Who was he, no... tomorrow he would ask himself that question. It was a difficult thing to remember, and he wasn't sure he would like the answer.
I closed my eyes, and waited for my end to come...

But in the end my nightmarish nap to die was disturbed by the only person naive enough out of my friends to belive me. Dammit Tomy it's always you who HAS to try to make everything good when I had no choice in the matter. He would come and find me, no matter where I hid, no matter who hid me, and for no price would he quit.
