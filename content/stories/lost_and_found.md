"Come on in, Lewis, it's open," Sharon called out loudly.

Lewis opened the door slowly, taking a deep breath before stepping into his sisters apartment.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING screams Lewis when he saw Sharon in the kitchen.
&quot;Just preparing the turkey for tonight dear!&quot; Sharon defended
Lewis was sure that something was off, but he couldn't tell what it might be
Lewis excuses himself to the bathroom and begins to looks around.

He had always been paranoid. Sharon remembered him always suspecting she had taken some of his candy or plotting to take his favorite toy.
