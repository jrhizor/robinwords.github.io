Somehow I got this far, midnight crescent moon lit walks beside the point until yesterday I thought I was doing okay doing without but now I feel like like an echo's echo merely a shadow beneath the blinding sun bleached out drained and left out for the wind to blow me like a man made plastic Walmart bag dancing alone across the big and empty fields outside my home.

Of course that home, among many other things, is gone now.
