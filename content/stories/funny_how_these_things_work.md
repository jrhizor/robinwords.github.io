As she was flipping through some old photos in a Facebook album from long ago she noticed a man, well rather a boy then, in the front. It was just his back and his head, but she knew it was him. She had spent long enough watching him to know. He was the man she was now in love with, unrequited, but she hadn't known him then. This picture was from an entire year before they had met.
She'd heard about this once. In a story about this couple, and a few weeks before their wedding they had been looking through old photo albums and found a picture of them together at Disney world. An entire 30 years before.

She realized she needed to meet this man again as he had left on a trip earlier that year. She gazed at the picture longingly. Realizing all the mistakes she made to meet this man.
