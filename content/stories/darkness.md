Darkness as far as the eye can see
shows not a glimpse of the light, but the light of a glimpse.
So brilliant is the light, that unwary travelers were often lured to the dark forest thinking the glimpse was refuge, rather than the deadly evil it represented.
Eeltu Fosgah dwelled within that darkness and had been a
evil malevolent force since the end of the Q'antir Elemental Wars.
Coll Merdit was one of the few who was unaffected by the stories, legends, and mysteries lurking within Wescan forest
