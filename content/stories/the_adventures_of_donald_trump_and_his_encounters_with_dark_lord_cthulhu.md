Donald Trump woke up in an empty void. It was an endless blackness that expanded as far as the eye can see. A voice thundered from on high. It was maddening, and shook the earth, as it thundered down, "WHO DARES CROSS INTO MY REALM?"

&quot;I cross into the best realms,&quot; The Don replies.

&quot;W... WHA... WHAT?&quot;

A dark figure appeared in the void. Don lifted his eyes to look, and saw Kim Jong-un approaching in a menacing manner, a frown furrowed across his face.
&quot;Oh, um....yeeeeeeeeah......I was told I was going to meet Cthulhu. Do you by any chance know where he is?&quot; Donald asked.
