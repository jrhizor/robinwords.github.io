The Lizard Lord had finally finished snacking on his favourite food, potatoes. Now it was time to snack on the flesh of his enemies. The first celebrity he devoured was
so bad tasting, that he never ate humans again. The Lizard Lord then went on to make peace with his enemies, and neighbouring lands.

However, that was when... THE WAFFLES INVADED!!!

&quot;Yippee!&quot; squealed the Lizard Lord, &quot;I adore waffles, and maybe they will finally get rid of the taste of Kardashian in my mouth!&quot;

However, the Lizard Lord did not know that these waffles were no ordinary, delicious, fluffy waffles.
