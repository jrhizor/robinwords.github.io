I felt ashamed. Here I had the whole world laugh at me using my invention. I wanted to hide away in my own dimension of magic away from technology, problems, and the world.

However, I didn't see all of the problems in my world. I didn't really understand it nearly as well as I thought i had. Some doors are best left shut.
It took me years to find this truth. Years of digging towards the unknown, of excitement at every clue that would lead me further into the depths of a pit that I did not know existed, towards the darkness that would soon ruin my innocence.
